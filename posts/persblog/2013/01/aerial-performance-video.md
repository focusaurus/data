OK, finally here's the video of my aerial fabric performance from our "Christmas Apocalypse" themed student show back in December. Yeah, the video quality is terrible. Yeah the venue is a rehearsal space and very much not a performance space. Yeah I haven't quite got good form or pointed feet yet. But anyway, it's still pretty cool, I think, and I'm more proud of it than I am embarassed, so here it is.

[Here is the full playlist for the show](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLstaMPf4_9pFv2q_t6DzKk381grwdVxpQ) if you want to see the other acts. It was really entertaining and I think given that it was a student show, the audience was really enjoying it.
