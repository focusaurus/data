Well, I spent most of Saturday at Atlas Purveyors giving my blog a web-based authoring system, so if all goes well this post will be published straight from the web.

I sold my 2008 Nissan Rogue SL today which makes my automobile minification process almost complete. One more set of Ts to cross and Is to dot, then it's done.

My new housemate moved into the basement apartment on Monday and so far so good. I went to my first Boulder Rock Club group fitness "Cry in the dojo" class on Tuesday and survived mostly intact. A bit sore today but not bad at all.

I have some fun plans for the weekend, but with the new low-friction blog system, I'll just tell you about them this weekend.
