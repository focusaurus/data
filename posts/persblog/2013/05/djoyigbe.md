Well, today this song was added to the very short list of pieces of music that have brought me to tears.

The song is "Djoyigbe" and was part of the soundtrack to the film [Pray the Devil Back to Hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pray_the_Devil_Back_to_Hell). It's no longer on youtube, but there's a recording on [Blake Leyh's web site](http://www.blakeleyh.com/#!music-/c1rwm). The song was composed by Blake Leyh and is performed beautifully by the great [Ang√©lique Kidjo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ang%C3%A9lique_Kidjo)

We are going to perform it at the Circus of Illumination in a few weeks and I spent most of the afternoon working on transcribing and arranging it. The vocals are stunning and powerful. Angelique Kidjo is going on my list to explore in more depth.
