So I was shopping around for live music and found a klezmer show at Barb√®s which is a short walk from my apartment, and it featured Ben Holmes - my old friend and roommate from summer music camp! It was all new original compositions and it was great. I don't think I've seen Ben in at least 6 years. I was also stoked to see the same venue is where the Slavic Soul Party weekly gig is on Tuesday nights, so I'm definitely going to check that out.

Recurse Center has been really great. It's so nice to be able to buckle down and work on self-motivated stuff all day for many weeks. Tomorrow I hope to practice some sax in a nearby music studio so my chops don't disappear entirely. Also planning to maybe get my initial "BeastIndex" fitness measurement at Brooklyn Boulders.
