## Results and Stats

- 26 total 4-spot problems up in the gym
- 16 attempted, 11 topped, 5 not topped, 10 not attempted
- over 2.5 hours climbing

Well, that was fun but exhausting and I didn't even hit the 50% mark. :-/

With some practice on the problems and another attempt before they reset too many, I could probably get to a 1/2 Tour de Fours.
