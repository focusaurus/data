Ah so it seems I haven't posted to my personal blog since February. I guess that's how it goes with social media handling most of the smaller updates.

The past few months Gora Gora Orkestar has been on a gigging rampage. We've been getting a huge variety of word of mouth gigs and some commercial gigs via gigmasters. We played, among others, a Rockies baseball game, a Sky Socks baseball game, a Rapids soccer game, a drag race/car show, Morrisson Ciderfest, a fancy HOA Oktoberfest, an Oktoberfest fundraiser at a huge mansion/estate, Denver first Friday art walk. Oh yeah, and we were out in Seattle for Honk Fest West back in June.

I've been trying to boulder regularly at The Spot. Here's a video of my first 4+ send.
