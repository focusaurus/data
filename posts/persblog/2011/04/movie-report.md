Here's a quick note on some movies I watched recently. I watched the climbing docudrama [Touching the Void](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touching_the_Void_(film)). It was pretty intense and riveting. I intended to watch it in small doses while eating, but ended up watching in just two big stretches. I'm stunned by folks with super-human will to live. I really don't know how to process it. I think I might now have to watch [The North Face](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0844457/) and maybe [127 Hours](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/127_Hours) (which I was planning to not watch).

I got two DVDs from the Louisville library as "impulse buys" on my way out. [Inglorious Basterds](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0361748/) was great. I usually don't know what to make of Tarantino films, but this was unexpectedly powerful and interesting. This is probably my #2 Tarantino film after Pulp Fiction now. I also started [The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1132620/), which I can tell is going to be great even though I've only watched the first half. Gotta love Noomi Rapace in this one.

That said, I'm feeling overwhelmed by films featuring tons of violence and evil. I think I might schedule a month of films about good people doing normal things for a while to check back in with reality.
