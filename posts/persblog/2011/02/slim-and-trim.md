I've completed two months on [the slow carb diet](http://gizmodo.com/#!5709913/4+hour-body-+-the-slow+carb-diet). Dropped between 8 and 10 pounds. I got my body fat measured this morning after "The Rapture" fitness class: **5.6%**. That's lower than I was expecting, but hey, I'll take it. w00t! Now my life long love affair with Triscuits and Swiss Cheese can continue.

In other related news, I've had the bad habit of biting my fingernails forever. Suddenly I've stopped biting 2 of my fingernails and they have grown for about two weeks or so. I have no idea why this has happened, but it gives me hope that I can kick the habit entirely. I chalk it up to in general just having more mental cycles available which translates directly to more motivation and willpower.
