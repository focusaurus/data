I'm in San Francisco this weekend. Staying in rooms rented via [airbnb](http://airbnb.com). So far so good this morning. I walked to Sunrise restaurant in The Mission for poached eggs with avocado, bacon, and spinach on English muffin. Yum. Then I hit Mission Cliffs for some exercise and bouldering. Stopped home for a shower and a nap and now I'm off to explore around and find some yummy lunch.
