Allow me to pose a question. What could be better than roller derby?  That's right! MORE roller derby.  I happened across an ad for another contest this Saturday between another local team called the [Lava City Roller Dolls](http://www.lavacityrollerdolls.com/) versus the visiting [Slaughter County Roller Vixens](http://www.slaughtercountyrollervixens.com/).  Oh such great delight.  This event was different from the previous one.  This was much more official: held in a real roller rink as opposed to a music venue, involving far more referees who seemed more concerned with accurate score tally, and having distinct rules and a penalty system.  So the rules part kind of stinks, but absent the flagrant tripping and throwing, the general body checking and frequent pile-ups were all there.

Today I walked up the nearby [Pilot Butte](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_Butte_(Oregon)) and got a nice look across the town.
