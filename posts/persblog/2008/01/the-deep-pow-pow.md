So things are cruising along nicely here in Boulder.  I've been skiing at [Winter Park](http://www.skiwinterpark.com/), [Eldora](http://www.eldora.com/), and [Copper Mountain](http://www.coppercolorado.com/) so far.  I've been loving the huge King Soopers supermarket that is open 24 hours and the Boulder Rock Club is great.  The cats have been fun and amusing when they aren't pooping or puking out of the litter box, which they do fairly regularly.  I busted Fred the neighbor's cat stealing food a few times, too.  I've been trying to get Elise in to Six Feet Under with good results so far and I have the [BBC Blue Planet documentaries](http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/programmes/tv/blueplanet/) here from NetFlix, which are pretty cool.

I'm reading up a lot on house buying and trying to get my finances understood and in order so I can get a mortgage, etc.  I'm going for a consultation with Uncle Bill's financial advisor tomorrow. Hopefully he won't react as poorly as my banker when I explained how all my Opsware stock earnings would be taxed in 2007: "Oh that is going to kill you. (Head in hands) That is definitely going to kill you."

Today I took off again to go skiing.  We went to Copper Mountain again and it was just spectacular. They had about five inches of fresh snow, sunny with a few scattered clouds, and zero wind.  It was a bit cold (15 degrees at the base) but we seemed to stay comfortable.  Elise, Les, and I took a group lesson on skiing bumps.  The lesson goes from 10 to 3.  In the morning in addition to our instructor Donny, we had Tom who is Donny's supervisor and also a good teacher, and Jerry, a ski patrol guy who was tagging along for the fun of it.  We all got some really good pointers and made a lot of progress on skiing moguls with the contemporary technique.  Poor Les was struggling a little bit since she has been skiing with her skis completely together in a tight slalom for a few decades and it's hard to adjust to the modern technique of having skiis about six inches apart.  The snow was perhaps the best I have skied.  We covered a lot of terrain (all with moguls) including the Spaulding Bowl on the back side.  The scenery at Copper Mountain is really spectacular at points, often enough to make you forget you're at 12,000 feet above the tree line in single digit temperatures.
