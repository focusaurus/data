Yesterday I drove 20 miles north from Bend to Smith Rock, the birthplace of modern American sport climbing. The rock formations and views are stunning. I saw some cool rock climbing going on as well. I'll post a few pictures here. Lots more (I filled up my camera) [on my web site](/app/photos?gallery=bend_2008_part_2).
