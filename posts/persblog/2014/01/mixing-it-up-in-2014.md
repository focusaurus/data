OK, I'll be making a bunch of nice intentional changes in 2014 and I'm pretty excited about that. First off, I quit the full-time position I held for the last 14 months in mid-December. I had been working on a stealth mode project that is finally out of stealth mode. I was the lead developer for a media-focused sharing site called [Trending](https://trending.com). At some point I'll write a post with my overall reflections on that project, but in broad strokes it was good but we built too many features before launching in my opinion so I was really anxious to launch it by the end. Now that it's launched I'm glad to have the autonomy that comes with part-time freelancing, part-time open source work, and part-time funemployment.

At the end of December I gave serious consideration to joining the team at [AirPair](http://airpair.com). I went out to San Francisco and worked with them for a week. After that experience though I reconsidered and decided at the moment I need to be in freelance mode.

After one more bad roommate experience in November, I've concluded I should mostly stick to just 1 roommate in my downstairs room. My current roommate Alex has been here a year and it's working out great so I'm just going to leave it at that for now. I may possibly do a bit more AirBnBing of one of the upstairs bedrooms, but I reclaimed my office and it's good to have a separate office and bedroom again.

I'm excited to have mid-day time available for side projects, open source, nonprofit coding, mentoring, etc. I plan to get a bit more active in the Boulder tech scene again. Also going to double down on [Gora Gora Orkestar](http://goragora.org) and hopefully compose an original tune for us this month. More on my 2014 plans as things develop.

In other miscellaneous news I was out in NJ and VT for Christmas. It was fun visiting with family and playing with my nephews. Back in Colorado, GGO played a gig at the Mercury Cafe for New Years Eve which was fine but I wish we had rehearsed the day before.

Today I jogged in shorts and a T-shirt to the rec center gym for a workout which felt nice. It's going to get cold again tomorrow though.
