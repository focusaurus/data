So it's been over a month and things have been humming along here. After Honk!Tx I had many rehearsals to get ready for the [Lucid](http://lucidshow.com) performance. My friend and bandmate Kate Jaworski had put together this circus show in collaboration with [Fractal Tribe](http://fractaltribe.com/), our circus/acro performance troupe. We did two performances of Lucid. It came together really well and both shows were sold out. It was fun for me to be involved in a theater production, which is outside my wheelhouse of live music. The show got picked up for five additional performances during the Boulder International Fringe Festival this September. Yay!

The Sunday after the Lucid performances a bunch of cast members met up for Dim Sum in Broomfield. We also just happened to run into Alice and Tung there, which was a funny coincidence. The Alice, Tung, Kim, and I went to see a [Wonderbound](http://wonderbound.com/) production called "Gone West". The group does modern dance collaborations with live music and they are very much world-class in terms of caliber of the work.

Afterward, Gora Gora Orkestar headed to Pearl St to busk. We have been busking a lot to raise money to help with our transporation costs for our trip to Seattle in June. I'm really looking forward to that. We got booked to play a big show in Fort Collins called Taste of Fort Collins and decided it would be worthwhile to forgo the San Francisco leg of the tour in order to play that gig, so that's the plan at the moment.

In April I've been doing a lot of consulting work, most of which is interesting with a few bits of drudgery here and there. GGO played a good gig at the Biergarten on April 25th to a very enthusiastic audience.

This past week I was scheduled to go see Holst's The Planets as well as a Golgol Bordello show on Tuesday night with Kim but I got sick so Ian went in my place. I felt pretty bad Tuesday and Wednesday. Thursday was the second rehearsal of a maybe new group focused on funky horn tunes with vocals in the style of Trombone Shorty.

Friday after work I did a long mountain bike ride from my house out to Cowdry Draw to Marshall Mesa up Eldorado Canyon Road to the Dowdy Draw trailhead then up and around Spring Brook Loop. I bumped into Stephen Angus along the way and rode with him for most of it.

Saturday I met up with some CHAOS folks and did a ride at Picture Rock trail in Lyons followed by lunch at Oskar Blues (which was terrible). Then Kim and I went to Shine before hitting The Boulder Theater for the Zoë Keating concert.

I find Zoë's music to be profoundly beautiful and was moved to tears twice during the first song.

I thought I was over my could but I'm still feeling a bit under the weather with a scratchy throat and some sinus congestion. Probably mountain biking 40 miles in 2 days didn't help me recover.
