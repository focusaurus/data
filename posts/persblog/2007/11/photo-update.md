OK, I've finally caught up on posting photos.

First, from the Romania trip, I only posted selected photos to this blog. For all of them see [my photos from Romania](/app/photos?gallery=romania_2007).

Then, photos from [Thorp's Halloween pumpkin carving party](/app/photos?gallery=halloween_2007).

A few shots from my [cross country road trip](/app/photos?gallery=cross_country_drive_2007).

And the first bunch of photos from [my stay in Santa Fe.](/app/photos?gallery=santa_fe_2007)

Today I went to a rock climbing contest (amateur - just for fun) at the Santa Fe Climbing Club and watched for a while.  Then I visited the [Museum of International Folk Art](http://www.internationalfolkart.org/), which had a very cool exhibit of quilts from [Gee's Bend](http://www.quiltsofgeesbend.com/), Alabama.  Then I did another walk around the main square.
