So unfortunately I have come down with a cold.  I should probably chalk it up to working late during the week.  In any case, Friday I had the worst sore throat I can remember, so I stayed in the hotel and rested.  I also had to skip out on today's road trip to Brasov, sadly.  I'm in the hotel now trying to rest and feel better and take care of some work things.
