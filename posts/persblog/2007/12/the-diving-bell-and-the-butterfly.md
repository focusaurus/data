When I returned to Santa Fe there was a dusting of snow on the ground and it stayed around most of the week as the temperatures were consistently low.  Finally Thursday and Friday it warmed back up into the forties.  This week was bad as far as work goes.  We completed primary coding on this release back in July and with the exception of a six-week stint on the next release, it's been pretty much nothing but bug fixing since then and it's really starting to wear on me.

In other news, I think I've secured a great home to rent in Boulder, Colorado next month.  There is a mind boggling series of logistics to get everything to fall into place, but hopefully all will work out.  According to Plan A (I have A-E or so), I'll be back "home" in Hoboken Dec 17-31.  If all goes according to plan we'll have a new tenant to take over by then and I can fully move out.

Tonight I went to see the film [The Diving Bell and the Butterfly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Diving_Bell_and_the_Butterfly_%28film%29) that is playing here as part of the [Santa Fe Film Festival](http://www.santafefilmfestival.com).  Wow.  I've never cried so consistently throughout a movie.  It was very touching a powerful.  Definitely recommended.
