Had a great climbing coaching session with [Chris Wall](http://www.totalclimbing.com/page.php?pname=training/personal) this morning. Did laps leading a 5.10 route. On the third lap, I was pretty sure there was no chance of getting to the top, but I surprised myself. I made the first four clips pretty easily and when I got to the last big jug before the push to the anchor I was like "I've got enough left to do this". I relaxed and did it and it felt really great. I listened to some fantastic [San Francisco Jazz Collective](http://www.sfjazz.org/SFJAZZCollective/2010/index.asp) on the way home with great vibes and marimba. I don't know why these awesome instruments aren't used more regularly. We need to hear a lot more vibes, marimba, bass clarinet, french horn, and trombone.

Tonight Michale and I are headed to a friend's house in Denver for games night. Let the weekend begin!
