Sunday I hiked the [Wapiti Trail](http://www.protrails.com/trail.php?trailID=4) up in Heil Valley just north of town with a group of eight from my hiking club. It was a really nice hike and a very friendly group. Very easy hiking but great mountain views. Next weekend I'm going to go back and bike it, which should be fun.
