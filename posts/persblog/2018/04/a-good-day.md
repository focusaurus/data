Yesterday was a good day. In the morning I dug through old mail for some due diligence receipts I need for the process of selling my house in Louisville. I am mostly blocked waiting on code review at work so I just had to do my standup call and a little AWS teardown work for another client. I had an early lunch then headed to Boxcar to tweak my new laptop configuration. After a brief nap I biked to Boulder Rock Club for fitness class which was good and envigorating. After that I stopped home to change then headed to the Happy Thursday Cruiser ride (cowboy costume theme), which was a lot of fun. I wound down watching some Lemony Snickett on NetFlix before exhaustion took over and I headed to bed pretty early.
