For years my favorite headphones were some [Mee Audio basic ear buds](http://a.co/hJyUoxh). They were cheap enough to shrug off getting lost or broken, tiny, lightweight, comfortable when worn with eyeglasses, and had the type of over-the-ear loops to keep them in place at the gym. Of course at $20 they are not audiophile gear, but I bought pairs in 2010, 2011, and 2016 and really liked them.

I was going to get yet another pair to replace my bluetooth over-the-ear headphones because they hurt when worn with eyeglasses and I was delighted to find that basically the exact same earbuds now come in a [wireless bluetooth version](http://a.co/0P0u30N) AND that version is also about $22.

So now I can keep my glasses on and also do air squats during my status calls.
