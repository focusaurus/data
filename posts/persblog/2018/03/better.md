So after the intensity of my time at Recurse Center I hit a bit of depression and was feeling bad for a while. Work was slow to start up after the sabbatical, it was winter and dark, etc. There was a good while there I wasn't feeling myself and typically my demeanor is pretty happy and motivation is generally plentiful.

It seems mostly better now. I've been doing some group fitness classes at Boulder Rock Club. It took three months, but I'm actually starting to feel my fitness level increase if only slightly.

I've got a little bit of work as well, which is good.

I put my soprano sax, tenor sax, bari sax, and clarinet on sale which felt both good and bad. One of my bandmates bought the bari so I'm glad that will be getting played. If I ever have need for those horns I can buy they, but they've been in the closet collecting dust long enough that it was time to let them go and use that cash for things that would actually be nice like a laptop with a battery that lasts more than 90 minutes.
