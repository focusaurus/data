Yesterday a group of friends hung out and camped at a mountain property called the "Hippocampus" out past Lyons, CO. We ate birthday cake, grilled meats, played crate stacking (my favorite sport), and chatted around the campsite.

I had to get up at 5 AM and hurriedly pack up my camp, drive to Boulder, make some final packing adjustments, then walk/run to the bus station to catch a 6:29 AM bus to Denver airport. I made it but only had about 4 minutes to spare. I'm on a layover in Pittsburgh now and heading to Stockholm shortly. It'll be my first visit to Sweden and I'm looking forward to it.
