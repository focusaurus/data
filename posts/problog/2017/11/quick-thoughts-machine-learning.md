Things machine learning plus UX teams seemingly can't get right yet: 

- Is this non-friend facebook message important or not?
- Do I care if this person liked some random thing on facebook? - Do I need notifications or directions to an event I'm already at?
- Am I in a vehicle right now?
- What zoom level would be useful for this map?
