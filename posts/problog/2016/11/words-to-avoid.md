I commonly groan as a new product, service, protocol, or format is launched with one of my trigger words in the name. To save you the effort of truly considering whether this word is justified in the name of your thing, here's a ready-made list of words that do not belong in the name of your thing:

- simple
- lightweight
- easy
- standard
- universal
- permanent

As a bonus, it is very likely that these words do not belong in the name of your thing, so only include them if they truly describe your thing:

- automatic
