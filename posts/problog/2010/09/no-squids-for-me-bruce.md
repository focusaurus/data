[Bruce Schneier](http://www.schneier.com/) is a leading author in the technology security and cryptography fields. He is exceedingly rational and pragmatic. I consider his insights on dealing with terrorism to be bar none the best available. His blog often has great insights. However, for reasons I can't understand, he always posts a random post on Fridays about squids. Yes, the sea creature. I don't know why, but it stopped being cute long ago.

To that end, I've created a [Yahoo Pipe Feed of the Schneier on Security blog with the Friday Squid Blogging filtered out](http://pipes.yahoo.com/peterlyons/schneiernosquids). Feel free to subscribe and enjoy.
