In this post I want to chronicle my learning of Clojure from the beginning.

# Things I gleaned before the official start
* Clojure is a lisp derivative for the JVM
* I have never programmed in lisp or any closely-related language
* lisp has macros, which I have read just a tiny bit about and seem appealing to me, at least out of curiosity

# Tuesday, August 21, 2012 7:17 AM MDT
* I watched the [Simple Made Easy](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy) talk, which I found through [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com/)
* I'm deeply focused on simplicity, which is what made me click through
* Rich Hickey has the calm, rational, zen-like manner of speaking that I really like, which is what made me watch the entire thing
  * This is a delightful contrast to the fast-talking young startup engineers that occupy a lot of my reading on the web

# Wednesday, August 22, 2012 8:05 PM MDT
(Note timestamp/day approximate. Sometime between Tue and Fri)
* Read a little bit just skimming around on [Clojure - Functional Programming for the JVM](http://java.ociweb.com/mark/clojure/article.html)
* Skimmed the wikipedia article on [persistent data structures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_data_structure) and was, as expected, surprised and disappointed by the confusing use of the word "persistent"

# Sunday, September 2, 2012 11:35 PM MDT
* Read [this Geek of the Week interview](http://www.simple-talk.com/opinion/geek-of-the-week/rich-hickey-geek-of-the-week/)
* Watched [this video: Are We There Yet](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Are-We-There-Yet-Rich-Hickey)

# 2018-01-07T11:45:14-0700
- http://vvvvalvalval.github.io/posts/2018-01-06-so-yeah-about-clojures-syntax.html

# 2018-09-06T08:41:03-0600
- started reading "Living Clojure"
- true, false, 42, 21.5, "foo", \a, :symbol, nil
- the idiom is to separate items in a list with just spaces, no commas

# 2018-09-08T14:04:54-0600
- lists are '(1 2 3 4 "foo" false 8.9)
- functions: first, rest, cons, list, last, nth, conj, count

# 2018-09-08T14:11:52-0600
- downloaded an anki deck to learn the clojure API

user=> (first '("a" "b" "c"))
"a"
user=> (last '("a" "b" "c"))
"c"
user=> (nth '("a" "b" "c") 1)
"b"
user=> (rest '("a" "b" "c"))
("b" "c")
user=> (cons 7 '("a" "b" "c"))
(7 "a" "b" "c")
user=> (conj '("a" "b" "c") 5 6 7)
(7 6 5 "a" "b" "c")

- conj is weird. It appends to vectors and prepends to lists
- it's polymorphic

user=> (keys {:foo "FOO", :bar "BAR"})
(:foo :bar)
user=> (vals {:foo "FOO", :bar "BAR"})
("FOO" "BAR")

- collections learned so far: list, vector, map
- scalars so far: integers, float, double ?, boolean, string, char
  - actually: boolean, integer, decimal, ratio, string, character, keyword

user=> (get {:foo "FOO", :bar "BAR"} :foo)
"FOO"
user=> (get {:foo "FOO", :bar "BAR"} :foo2)
nil
user=> (get {:foo "FOO", :bar "BAR"} :foo2 "default")
"default"

- use keyword as a function
user=> (:foo {:foo "FOO" :bar "BAR"})
"FOO"

- map functions, keyword as function, get, keys, vals, assoc, dissoc, merge
- sets are #{} syntax

- get, set, contains, intersection, union, conj, disj

# 2018-09-08T14:55:27-0600
- functions: apply, defn, fn
- let block and def block
- str to concatenate strings

# 2018-09-08T15:03:24-0600
- Switch to a namespace with (ns foo.bar)
- *ns* to display repl's active namespace

# 2018-09-10T14:49:13-0600
- boolean functions: true? false? not nil?
- false and nil are the only logically false values
- empty?
- why don't seq and some end in question mark?

# 2018-09-10T16:47:11-0600
- (if) is basically the ternary operator
- control flow with: if when if-let when-let


# 2018-09-11T10:16:22-0600
- partial for currying and partial application
- comp to compose

user=> (let [surprise #((comp oh-my toggle-grow) %)]
  #_=> (surprise :small)
  #_=> )
"Oh my! You are growing :big"


# 2018-09-13T17:02:52-0600
- some new functions: take, range, count, class, repeat


# 2018-09-13T17:06:17-0600
* user=> (repeatedly 5 #(rand-int 885))
(0 690 27 655 522)


# 2018-09-17T09:35:32-0600
- complement, filter, nil?, keyword?

(def creatures [:mouse nil :rat nil :cat :dog])
(filter (complement nil?) creatures)
(filter nil? creatures)

(for [animal creatures]
  (str (name color))

user=> (for [animal (filter keyword? creatures)]
  #_=>   (str (name animal)))
("mouse" "rat" "cat" "dog")

# 2018-09-17T09:42:41-0600
- for loop has 1 or more name bindings, optional :let vector, optional :when condition
- into, sorted-map, flatten, partition, partition-all
