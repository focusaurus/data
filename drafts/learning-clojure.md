In this post I want to chronicle my learning of Clojure from the beginning.

# Things I gleaned before the official start
* Clojure is a lisp derivative for the JVM
* I have never programmed in lisp or any closely-related language
* lisp has macros, which I have read just a tiny bit about and seem appealing to me, at least out of curiosity

# Tuesday, August 21, 2012 7:17 AM MDT
* I watched the [Simple Made Easy](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy) talk, which I found through [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com/)
* I'm deeply focused on simplicity, which is what made me click through
* Rich Hickey has the calm, rational, zen-like manner of speaking that I really like, which is what made me watch the entire thing
  * This is a delightful contrast to the fast-talking young startup engineers that occupy a lot of my reading on the web

(Note timestamp/day approximate. Sometime between Tue and Fri)
* Read a little bit just skimming around on [Clojure - Functional Programming for the JVM](http://java.ociweb.com/mark/clojure/article.html)
* Skimmed the wikipedia article on [persistent data structures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_data_structure) and was, as expected, surprised and disappointed by the confusing use of the word "persistent"

# Sunday, September 2, 2012 11:35 PM MDT
* Read [this Geek of the Week interview](http://www.simple-talk.com/opinion/geek-of-the-week/rich-hickey-geek-of-the-week/)
* Watched [this video: Are We There Yet](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Are-We-There-Yet-Rich-Hickey)
